Welcome to my Github profile!

👨‍💻 About Me
🎓 I'm a developer and computer science student currently exploring the world of code. 
🤖 I have a strong interest in logic, algorithms, and solving complex problems, which makes me particularly enjoy back-end development. 
🎨 I also love expressing creativity through code and bringing ideas to life, so I have fun working on front-end development as well.
